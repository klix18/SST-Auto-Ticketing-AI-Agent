## **Make New Package — Description**

**Definition:** No imagery for the film/series (or the specific season) exists in **PMAM** (our DAM/CMS). No images can be found in PMAM. Third Party vendors may have just delivered the needed assets to make the package. The request is to **build the full package** and ingest to PMAM.   
User Prompt Examples**:**

* “Vendor delivered a new title. Please make the art.”  
* “I can’t find this title/season in PMAM.”  
* “When can you make/ when can we expect the artwork?”

**Deliverable:** Full package built (incl. any planned episodics), ingested into PMAM.  
**Key distinction:** **“Not in PMAM”** \= never made → this category (not a platform publish issue). This has nothing to do with publishing to Atom or Skyshowtime Platform.

## **Add Missing Image Assets — Description**

**Definition:** Some imagery exists in PMAM for a certain title or series of a title, but **a subset is missing**: territories/localizations, episodics, or special variants. The request is to **add what’s missing**. The most common scenario is when newer episodes are missing while everything else have been delivered to PMAM.  
User Prompt Examples**:**

* Episodic imagery missing for certain episodes (e.g., 5–7).  
* Specific language localizations not ingested in PMAM, while other languages have been ingested.
* Can't find certain images
* Can't find/locate episodic imagery

**Not this:**

* “Nothing in PMAM” → **Make New Package**.  
* “Push/publish to Atom / missing on platform” → **Publish Artwork to Platform**.  
* “Swap/replace/fix quality/localize existing” → **Change Existing Image Assets**.

## **Publish Artwork to Platform — Description**

**Definition:** Imagery exists in **PMAM** but is **not visible on the platform** yet. The ask is to **publish/push** the relevant images from PMAM to **Atom** so they appear on **SkyShowTime (platform)**.   
**Important dependency:** We **cannot push** until the **corresponding videos** have been uploaded to PMAM by the video team.  
 **Examples:**

* “Images are missing **on platform**.”  
* “Longform has delivered their content, can you please push/publish the artwork”  
* “I don’t see the images in **Atom**.”  
* “Launch in 5 days—please **push/publish** the artwork.”

**Deliverable:** Publish/push requested images to Atom and verify platform visibility.  
**Key distinction:** **“Missing on platform/Atom”** ≠ “not in PMAM.” If not in PMAM, that’s **Make New Package**.

## **Change Existing Image Assets — Description**

**Definition:** Imagery exists but must be **changed/replaced/fixed**. Typical changes:

* **Localization swaps** (e.g., “Bulgarian unlocalized”: English files in a territory that should be localized → replace with Bulgarian); requests may use language **codes** (e.g., **hr-HR** for Croatian). Below are the 20 different languages that their respective language codes:  
  * Albanian \-\> “sq-AL”  
  * Bosnian \-\> “bs-BA”  
  * Bulgarian \-\> “bg-BG”  
  * Croatian \-\> “hr-HR”  
  * Czech \-\> “cs-CZ”  
  * Danish \-\> “da-DK”  
  * Dutch \-\> “nl-NL”  
  * English \-\> “en-US”  
  * Finnish \-\> “fi-FI”  
  * Hungarian \-\> “hu-HU”  
  * Macedonian \-\> “mk-MK”  
  * Norwegian \-\> “nb-NO”  
  * Polish \-\> “pl-PL”  
  * Portuguese (European) \-\> “pt-PT”  
  * Romanian \-\> “ro-RO”  
  * Serbian \-\> “sr-RS”  
  * Slovakian \-\> “sk-SK”  
  * Slovenian \-\> “sl-SI”  
  * Spanish (Castilian) \-\> “es-ES”  
  * Swedish \-\> “sv-SE”  
* **Studio-mandated** artwork updates (replace KA/IH/EPISODIC).  
* **Title Treatment (TT) compliance/quality fixes** (TT must be pure white on dark BG; remove blending/shadows; quality/legibility corrections).  
* **Language-code corrections** in filenames.

**Deliverable:** Update/replace targeted assets in PMAM and, if requested, **re-publish** to Atom.  
**Not this:**

* Request to **add missing** coverage (episodes/localizations/variants) → **Add Missing Image Assets**.  
* **New** title/season with zero PMAM presence → **Make New Package**.  
* “Push/publish” only → **Publish Artwork to Platform**.
